most important fixes!!!!!

make file decoding recursive based on what modules are found, rather then everything

- GLOBAL TODO
ISSUES IN THING LIKE:
-- UNIT TESTS FOR EACH PART OF THE DECODED VHDL FILE


LOCAL TODO:

SIGNAL TRACE:
can follow a port or signal if there is an assign not inside a process
--process decoding started, at the moment it just finds all the assignments in a process and assigns them 
to the process, either find a way of tagging assignments in the trace
as belonging to a process IF or case statement

!!!!!*** check this works, find a process with a clean assigment in it

at the momnet signal trace is handles pure assignments
so   "a <= b"
need to add ranged assignment a <= b(4 downto 0)
need to add concatinated assignement a <= b & c & d


------------------------

wrapper doesnt decode (1 downto 2) or named types

---------

fix up instanceation!!!! its broken,
also makje a thing to create signals at the top od the instancviation, so there are signals for all the connections

cant handle this:
signal current_state, next_state: FSM_States;

add unit tests for more of the functions, and fill out the tests where apropriate

parser cant handle primitives, it doesnt know what those are, so it doesnt recognise them as childeren


need to speed up, this is slow when processing 1k files +
--- done, need to add test for this feature
huge speed up!!!!!!!! 200%

doesent identify variabvles 
interger doesnt calculate range


widths on ports like this in test 8 return none, shoudl return the string
input     : in  std_logic_vector(TOPWIDTH*WIDTH-1 downto 0);

trace sig:
can it do port names?
can it do signals? 
can it do generics?
can it do constants?

how to handle multiple version of the same unnamed module


make cl tree print different levels in different terminal colours, need way to turn off
cl tree looks like it is getting double the depth for some reason

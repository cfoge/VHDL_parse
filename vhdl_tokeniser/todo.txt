most important fixes!!!!!

make file decoding recursive based on 

make tests for:
CL tree
wrapper
instanceation
ect....
- 
ISSUES IN THING LIKE:
- make individual higher level unit tests, like somthing to 
decode a port, 
find assignaments
decode generarte
primitive detection
array decoding


add more unit tests for all functions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
important!!!!!!!

make unit tests that test fragments of vhdl!!!!!

wrapper doesnt decode (1 downto 2) or named types

---------

fix up instanceation!!!! its broken,
also makje a thing to create signals at the top od the instancviation, so there are signals for all the connections

cant handle this:
signal current_state, next_state: FSM_States;

add unit tests for more of the functions, and fill out the tests where apropriate

parser cant handle primitives, it doesnt know what those are, so it doesnt recognise them as childeren


need to speed up, this is slow when processing 1k files +
--- done, need to add test for this feature
huge speed up!!!!!!!! 200%

doesent identify variabvles 
interger doesnt calculate range


widths on ports like this in test 8 return none, shoudl return the string
input     : in  std_logic_vector(TOPWIDTH*WIDTH-1 downto 0);

trace sig:
can it do port names?
can it do signals? 
can it do generics?
can it do constants?

how to handle multiple version of the same unnamed module


make cl tree print different levels in different terminal colours, need way to turn off
cl tree looks like it is getting double the depth for some reason

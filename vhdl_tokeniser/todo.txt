most important fixes!!!!!

make file decoding recursive based on what modules are found, rather then everything

- GLOBAL TODO
ISSUES IN THING LIKE:
-- UNIT TESTS FOR EACH PART OF THE DECODED VHDL FILE
-- wrap up pin code into a CHECK FPGA and MAKE FPGA script
-- find the best method for saving data from processes like tree-cl to reuse later in other functions

future features::
-build into tree-cl a method to pass a file name and have it highlighted, thios vould be wraped into the find comands to show only the path of the hieracy to what you are interested in
--
- project files to aurtomate alot of functiosn and speed up file discovery
- only anilise files as needed
- make way of searching for unused signals ect and remove them (optinal)
- make print outs be clickible links

LOCAL TODO:

check all my tools in tools folder actualy work

SIGNAL TRACE:
can follow a port or signal if there is an assign not inside a process
--process decoding started, at the moment it just finds all the assignments in a process and assigns them 
to the process, either find a way of tagging assignments in the trace
as belonging to a process IF or case statement

trace signal need a way to handle a re assignement that doesnt lead intop another instance!!!! at the moment it just ignores it
which is fine for the graph of modules, but is needed for the paths list in the CLI

!!!!!*** check this works, find a process with a clean assigment in it

at the momnet signal trace is handles pure assignments
so   "a <= b"
need to add ranged assignment a <= b(4 downto 0)
need to add concatinated assignement a <= b & c & d


------------------------

wrapper doesnt decode (1 downto 2) or named types

---------

fix up instanceation!!!! its broken,
also makje a thing to create signals at the top od the instancviation, so there are signals for all the connections

cant handle this:
signal current_state, next_state: FSM_States;

add unit tests for more of the functions, and fill out the tests where apropriate

parser cant handle primitives, it doesnt know what those are, so it doesnt recognise them as childeren


            ----done need to speed up, this is slow when processing 1k files +
            --- done, need to add test for this feature
            huge speed up!!!!!!!! 200%

doesent identify variabvles 
interger doesnt calculate range


widths on ports like this in test 8 return none, shoudl return the string
input     : in  std_logic_vector(TOPWIDTH*WIDTH-1 downto 0);

trace sig:
can it do port names?
can it do signals? 
can it do generics?
can it do constants?

how to handle multiple version of the same unnamed module


done---->make cl tree print different levels in different terminal colours, need way to turn off
fixed ---->cl tree looks like it is getting double the depth for some reason

cant handle this:
signal current_state, next_state: FSM_States;

need to speed up, this is slow when processing 1k files +
--- done, need to add test for this feature
huge speed up!!!!!!!! 200%

doesent identify variabvles 
interger doesnt calculate range


widths on ports like this in test 8 return none, shoudl return the string
input     : in  std_logic_vector(TOPWIDTH*WIDTH-1 downto 0);

doesnt find components

cant decode this:
logger : write_file_ex
        port map (
            clk  => clk_25_in,
            hs   => clk_x_out,   
            vs   => clk_y_out,  
            r    => RBG(7 downto 0),
            g    => RBG(15 downto 8),
            b    => RBG(23 downto 16)
            
        );

if component declared above

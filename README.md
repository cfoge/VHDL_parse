# VHDL_parse üöÄ
A collection of Python tools to simplify your VHDL workflow without heavyweight IDEs like Vivado or Quartus. Great for automating boring tasks in VHDL!

Open to donations and contributors with VHDL or Python experience. üòÄ 

## Purpose
Designed to run in the command line, VHDL_parse lets you explore, navigate and manipulate VHDL files effortlessly. No additional libraries required, just the magic of Python3.

## Tools üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
#### found in the "vhdl_tokeniser/tools" folder 
##### Searching:
Find command, searches VHDL files in directory for VHDL FEATURE matching string.
**farch.py/ftype.py/fconst.py/fpack.py...**
| Arg 1        | Arg 2           |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| search string     | -d directory|


#### Working Python Comand Line Scripts
- **instanc.py** = creates a template instantiation from a VHDL file in the terminal or as a .txt file
- **component.py** = creates a template component decleration from a VHDL file in the terminal or as a .txt file
- **wrapper.py** = create a wrapper that declares an entity, instantiates the VHDL files passed to it annd optionally creates signals with matching port names connected to each instance.

##### Current features:
- Display VHDL module hierarchies from directory
- Auto-generate entity and module instantiations
- Auto generate VHDL wrappers for multiple entitys
##### Future potential:
- Test bench creation automation
- Signal tracing/search through multiple files
- Diff two vhdl files by port,generics,contants ect.. rather then line by line like a regular diff would

### what_in.py üìú
List VHDL entities, constants, attributes, signals, and processes:

| Arg 1        | Arg 2           |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| vhdl file     | param (optional)|

The second (optional) is a parameter to filter the results:
"f" shows all
"a" shows attributes
"v" shows variables
"c" shows constants
"p" shows processes
"s" shows signals

Example: 
```bash
what_in.py input.vhd a
```


### make_xdc.py üß©
Transform the ports on your top-level VHDL file into a constraints file in either Xilinx or Quartus format with make_xdc.py. Just two inputs needed:

| Arg 1        | Arg 2           | Arg 3 (optional)|
| ------------- |:-------------:| ------------- |
| XDC output file name    | Input Top level.vhd file| q (quartus mode)|

Example: 
```bash
check_xdc.py output input.vhd 
```
(optional 3rd argument "q" generates Quartus output)


#### I hope these scripts make your FPGA and VHDL work a bit smoother! I use them all the time and they have saved me countless hrs already. üéâ
